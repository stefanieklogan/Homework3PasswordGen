## Project overview

* This assignment was the most challenging to-date. I really spent time reviewing all week 3 activities and teaching myself again the concepts and code. I will admit when I started psuedo coding the password generator, I had several "how will I do that step" moments circling in my mind. I gave myself grace because *knowing what steps are needed* is first & there's no research & writing code without it.

* I appreciate the real-world application of this homework. Websites more often than not require a profile & credentials. Credential stores are important for validation purposes and allowing users into sites they've been to before.

## Psuedo code

* Psuedo coding is not necessarily unfamiliar behavior for me. I make a list before going to the grocery store. I write down household projects that need to be tackled in the coming month. Psuedo coding is similar and creates a roadmap before you even put the key in the ignition. It helps keep focus and hopefully makes your fingers key the code a bit quicker because of this prework.

## Building the Code & Java

* My name is Stefanie and I admit that I have a problem. I admit that I tend to write more code than I should before I validate. Maybe it's 2-3 lines, but it's 2-3 lines too many. I am improving my patience and trying to validate code one line at a time so I know what I just coded is the issue. It doesn't take long right now for me to run into errors. Ah the learning!

* If you're reading this, I don't drink coffee. I do, however, have java running thru my veins at this point knowing I survived teh assignment. Have I already expressed how much I learned in this assignment?

## What I'm proud of most

* I've always loved concatenate in Excel. Sadly, it 'wows' my coworkers when I can provide a list of 1k people with "last name, first name" and it took 30 seconds. Why am I sharing this? I love that concatenate array was one of the big "ah ha" moments when it came to solving user-driven booleans into the password creation.

* I'm proud of the work I put in prior to this assignment, meeting with a tutor as well as finishing it with a real understanding of what the document does. Coding is a rollercoaster with a lot of peaks and valleys. The peak is my favorite part. :)

## Additional learnings

* I'm proud of what I've accomplished. I found the rock-paper-scissors exercise in class to be extremely difficult and this assignment doesn't back down either.

* I made a "copy" button! It's a good, good feeling when advice on Google actually makes sense and works. Implementation was easy.
