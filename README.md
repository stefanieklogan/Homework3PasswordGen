## Project overview

* This assignment was the most challenging to-date. I really spent time reveiwing all week 3 activities and teaching myself again the concepts and code. I will admit when I started psuedo coding the password generator, I had several "how will I do that step" moments circling in my mind. I gave myself grace because knowing the code is needed is the first step before beginning the research to write and implement new code.

* I appreciate the real-world application of this homework. Websites more often than not require a profile & credentials. Credential stores are important for validation purposes and allowing users into sites they've been to before.

* Even though I've done two assignments focused on html, the exercise putting together the css classes into the html file felt a little like dusting of my memory. I need to continue to code daily to keep things as fresh as possible, turning back to old assignments and looking ahead as well.

## Psuedo code

* Psuedo coding is not necessarily unfamiliar behavior for me. I make a list before going to the grocery store. I write down household projects that need to be tackled in the coming month. 

* Psuedo coding is similar and creates a roadmap before you even put the key in the iginition. It helps keep focus and hopefully makes your fingers key the code a bit quicker because of this prework.

## Additional learnings

* I'm proud of what I've accomplished. I found the rock-paper-scissors exercise in class to be extremely difficult and this assignment doesn't back down either.
